The Challenge 

The greatest sources of innovation are examples of local adaptation seen in the natural world that have emerged over 3.8 billion years of R&D through the process of evolution. Due to the specialisation mentioned earlier our knowledge and understanding of these fields are increasingly held by relatively fewer individuals, albeit to an increasing depth. Nowadays many people are born into cities and spend most of their adult life living in urban environments so no longer have access to natural sources of inspiration either. The likelihood of our industrious young minds becoming specialists in architecture and engineering at the same time as biology and natural history are less and less likely, let alone becoming like the generalists that were present amongst our previous generations. 

So in order to improve the opportunities for designers and architects across the world to gain understanding and take inspiration from the regional and local environments in which they work, we need to find ways to deliver relevant local information to them in ways they understand, can identify opportunities and thus give consideration to within their designs. The theory being that improved local understanding and sensitivity will then lead to more enhanced, efficient and sustainable outcomes.
