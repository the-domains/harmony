The Solution 

Due to the aforementioned specialisation of individuals working in these fields and the level of complex 
understanding such disciplines increasingly require its vital that the communication of additional locally 
relevant information is clear, controllable and delivered in graphical formats preferred by and useful to 
designers rather than the language of historians, naturalists, ecologists, surveyors or other ICT 
(predominantly BIM and GIS) professionals. So the solution is to design and build technology that facilitates 
the translation of data from a wide variety of sources into easy to access, clear and understandable 
information for designers to be able to learn from. 

This will require a sophisticated collection of application 
program interfaces (APIs) and algorithms to be developed that enable interaction between the various 
sources of data and the design tools to deliver an intuitively easy and attractive, graphical user interface.
