Recent Developments 

In recent years information technology progress has made available new resources to model building design 
and also to increasingly assess their viability and suitability prior to construction. New sources of locally 
relevant data are also becoming available (historical, cultural and scientific) that can assist in this process to 
further improve understanding and reduce risk. Bringing these sources of data together and presenting them 
in ways that are easy and useful for designers to use, is the key to success. 

Building Information Modelling 
(BIM) and Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) both started to emerge as disciplines in the 1970s as 
building design and urban planning tools respectively. They're similar in many ways as visual representations 
of building design and geographical data sets but have for the most part been evolving as separate 
disciplines, the integration of which is widely believed to hold huge potential for improved delivery of locally 
relevant data.
