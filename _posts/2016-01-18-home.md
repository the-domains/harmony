Background 

Buildings and urban environments across the world are remarkably monomorphic despite the large variety of 
climates and geospatial environments inhabited. The impact of this is that many buildings are inefficient, 
damaging to the environment and can be unnecessarily expensive to build and operate over their lifecycle. 
The reasons for this are likely due to the globalised provision of design and architectural services and the 
increased sharing of so called "best practice" from one region to another over the last hundred years. 

Over the same period our academic institutions and corporations have both placed an increasing emphasis 
on individual career specialisation as the majority of the working population has shifted from rural agricultural 
and manufacturing based environments to more urban office based ones. The impact of these changes 
might some argue, be limiting the potential of the workforce by impacting their health and well being but this 
article suggests it might also be limiting our ability to find sources of innovation and ways to improve built 
environment design.
